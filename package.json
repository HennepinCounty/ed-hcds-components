Therefore, please point your NPM imports to a specific Git commit ID, using the public GitHub URL for that commit.  For example, '@hennepincounty/ed-hcds-components': 'git+https://github.com/HennepinCounty/ed-hcds-components.git#some-commit-id-here'.  There are no executables in this codebase, but that will at least allow you to refer to the CSS files from a predictable file path within 'node_modules'."
